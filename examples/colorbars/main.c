Anykey                 VGA

GPIO2.2  ---[200R]---  Red       (VGA Pin  1)
GPIO2.1  ---[200R]---  Green     (VGA Pin  2)
GPIO2.0  ---[200R]---  Blue      (VGA Pin  3)
GND      ----------+-  GND       (VGA Pin  5)
                   +-  Red GND   (VGA Pin  6)
                   +-  Green GND (VGA Pin  7)
                   +-  Blue GND  (VGA Pin  8)
                   +-  Sync GND  (VGA Pin 10)
GPIO1.7  ------------  HSync     (VGA Pin 13)
GPIO1.6  ------------  VSync     (VGA Pin 14)

R should be 200 Ohms. If you're curious why:
According to VGA spec, impedance of R, G, and B lines is 75 Ohms. High level should be 0.7 volts.
With 200 Ohms in series, total pin load is 275 Ohms. At 3.3V operating voltage, we have

I = 3.3V / 275 Ohms = 12mA.

This load is ok for output pins. According to LPC343 data sheet, section 9, note 14, up to 45mA
are allowed as long as the maximum device current rating is not exceeded.
Section 9.3, Fig. 17, shows that the pin will have approximately 2.5V at 12mA load, room temperature.
The 200/75 Ohms voltage divider (our resistor and the line) will make  

2.5V * (75 Ohms / 275 Ohms) = 0.681V.

Close enough, safe side.

If you don't have a 200 Ohms resistor at hand, use 220 Ohms. They are easier to get (E6 series).
Image will be slightly darker, but ok. If you have the choice, use metallic film resistors, 1%.
Power dissipation is less than 0.05W per resistor, so almost any type and shape will do.

HSync and VSync lines should be TTL level. Can work if the monitor's input impedance is high enough.

Cables should be as short as possible as we probably violate the 75 Ohms line impedance. In addition,
we add capacities and other dirt into high frequency signal lines, which should be avoided.
