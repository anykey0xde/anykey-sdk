  Description UM10375 Chapter 20:

  The ADC is configured using the following registers:

	1. Pins: The ADC pin functions are configured in the IOCONFIG register
	block (Section 7.4).

	2. Power and peripheral clock: In the SYSAHBCLKCTRL register, set bit
	13 (Table 25). Power to the ADC at run-time is controlled through the
	PDRUNCFG register (Table 55).
