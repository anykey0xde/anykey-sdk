... a quick word about renaming.


Just a quick notice to anyone potentially tracking these repositories: we've been informed that 
we are causing some confusion with an IT-system house named anykey GmbH.

In case you are looking for a company called 'anykey GmbH' in Sankt Augustin, Germany,
providing Oracle, EMC, and similar data center solutions, we apologize
for any inconvenience or confusion we may have caused. You want to be
[here](http://www.anykey.de/).

If you're looking for an Open Source ARM Cortex M3 embedded development board, we've moved all 
our Open Source efforts to a new github account [presseverykey](https://github.com/presseverykey).

Thanks and again, apologies for any confusion.
